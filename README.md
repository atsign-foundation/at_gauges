## Who is this for?
The README should be addressed to somebody who's never seen this before.
But also don't assume that they're a novice.
-->
The at_gauges package is for Flutter developers who want to build beautiful and customizable gauges.

<!---
Give some context and state the intent - we welcome contributions - we want
pull requests and to hear about issues. Include the boilerplate language
below to add some context to @â€Žplatform packages

<!-- - Range radial gauge -->
  <!--- add package features here -->

We welcome suggestions you may have to create more gauges or to add features to gauges already created. 

<!---
Does this package publish to pub.dev or similar? This README will be the
first thing that developers see there and should be written such that it
lets them quickly assess if it fits their need.
-->
## Get started
There are two options to get started using this package.

<!---
If the package has a template that at_app uses to generate a skeleton app,
that is the quickest way for a developer to assess it and get going with
their app.
-->
<!-- ### 1. Quick start - generate a skeleton app with at_app
This package includes a working sample application in the
[Example](./example) directory that you can use to create a personalized
copy using ```at_app create``` in four commands.

```sh
$ flutter pub global activate at_app 
$ at_app create --sample=<package ID> <app name> 
$ cd <app name>
$ flutter run
```
Notes: 
1. You only need to run ```flutter pub global activate``` once
2. Use ```at_app.bat``` for Windows -->
